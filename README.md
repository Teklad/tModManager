# tModManager

The goal of this application is to provide an easy to use interface for managing your Terraria mods as well as launching the game all from one location.

On top of this, I strongly believe that we as programmers have a tendency to abuse modern libraries to the point it degrades the performance of our applications in more cases than we'd like to admit.  With this in mind I intend to keep this software as light as possible.  Just the features that are legitamitely useful and no gimmicky stuff.

Sorry for the long delay on the progress of this.  My work picked up pretty heavy so I ran out of time to do anything.

### Planned Features
* Simple graphical user interface that's both easy to navigate as well as intuitive
* Resource viewing from within the GUI.  This is of course going to respect the mod authors preferences.  Mod authors worked hard to give us excellent product so undermining them would be shameful.
* Downloading/updating of mods from within the GUI.
* Possible auto-update/update-notification styled features.
